Predicting Condition of the wells, functioning and non functioning pumps basing on sort of pump installed and whe
Overview
#The dataset is provided by the Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water to predict the condition of a water well, basing on the sort of pump and when it was installed, so that the Government of Tanzania in patternship with NGOs can find new patterns of constructing new wells and provide clean water to Tanzanian people.. 🚀

Problem Statement 🤔
Predicting condition of the wells basing on the sort of pump installed and when in order the government and NGO have a clear pattren of installing new waterpoints for sustainable water.

Key Features 🔑
Data-Driven Insights: We use advanced data analytics and machine learning to provide you with precise factors fo checking wells condition.
User-Friendly Interface: Our interactive web application lets you input property details and instantly get an estimated price. No complex data analysis required!


Data Sources 📊
Our model has been painstakingly trained on a diversified dataset of real estate transactions, guaranteeing that it can deliver reliable estimates across a wide range of property kinds and locations.

Objectives 🎯
Our core objectives include:

Creating a predictive model for predicting new patterns for building updated wells in order the Government and the NGO provide clean and reliable water to its population based on the decision.

Methodology 📈
Our process includes the following steps:

Data Collection: We acquired from the .
Data Preprocessing: To remove inconsistencies and make the data acceptable for analysis, we thoroughly cleaned and prepared it.
Feature Engineering: To increase model accuracy, we identified key characteristics and engineered new ones.
Data merging for perfect cleaning
Model Selection: To construct the prediction model, we used advanced machine learning approaches, fine-tuning algorithms for best performance.
Data splitting for building accuracy modelling
Model Testing: Extensive testing and validation were carried out to assure the accuracy and dependability of the model.
